            <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
            <div class="under">
                <img src="images/Zillow.png" alt="zillow screenshot">
                <div class="content">
                <a href="https://www.zillow.com/"><h3>Zillow</h3></a>
                <p>On the mobile Zillow homepage, the very first thing you see, and the element that makes up the majority of the screen, is the input box asking for the area you are planning to move to. This directs the userâ€™s right to the interaction for which they came to the website. In later pages, you can specify renting or buying, how many beds, etc, but on the homepage, it only asks one question that leads the user right to what they need. An excellent example of simplifying the user experience. </p>

            <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>

                <img src="images/Knit.png" alt="Knit screenshot">
                <div class="content">
                 <a href="https://shitthatiknit.com/"><h3>Sh*t That I Knit</h3></a>
                  <p>When you put a three by three grid on top of the homepage for Sh*t that I Knit, each of the three main title sections fits nicely into the grid. As for the vertical grid, on the bottom section, one picture is placed in each of the three grid sections. Most of the other content is centered on the center grid and spilling over into the other two grid sections. I thought that this website showed the rule of thirds very nicely in the horizontal grid. </p>

            <h2>Contrast</h2>
            <div class="under">
                <img src="images/Harvest.png" alt="Drink Screenshot">
               <div class="content">
                <a href="https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/"><h3>Half Baked Harvest</h3></a>
                <p>The contrast on this website is between vibrant and rather busy photos and understated titles, text, and background. In this picture, the drink and the objects surrounding the drink are colorful pinks and reds on a dark grey surface. When that is contrasted with the white background and simple font, the majority of the attention is given to the picture and the attractiveness of it. I think this level of contrast is great for a food blog.  </p>
